Two-Way Encryption Sample

Two-Way Encryption Sample is a quick and dirty application that shows you how to perform simple two-way encryption using the System.Cryptography NameSpace.

The program allows you to enter a username and password and then encrypt these two pieces of information. The encrypted information is stored in a text file (The Key and IV are stored in the file as well). Decryption is shown off when you re-open the application as it reads the previously encrypted file and restores the data.
